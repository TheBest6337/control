/// Implements the `MachineAct` trait for the `MockMachine`.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `_now_ts`: The current timestamp of type `Instant`.
///
/// # Returns
/// A pinned `Future` that resolves to `()` and is `Send`-safe. The future encapsulates the asynchronous behavior of the `act` method.
///
/// # Description
/// This method is called to perform periodic actions for the `MockMachine`. Specifically:
/// - It checks if the time elapsed since the last measurement emission exceeds 33 milliseconds.
/// - If the condition is met and the machine is in Running mode, it emits a sine wave data event.
/// - State events (frequency, mode) are only emitted when values change, not continuously.
///
/// The method ensures that the sine wave value is updated approximately 60 times per second (16ms intervals) when running.
///
